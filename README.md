## SEO Configuration

### robots.txt

The `robots.txt` file is located at the root of the project and is used to control how search engine crawlers index the site. It can specify which pages should or should not be crawled by search engines.

- **Location:** `/robots.txt`
- **Purpose:** Directs web crawlers on which pages to index or avoid.


### sitemap.xml

The `sitemap.xml` file is also located at the root of the project. It provides search engines with a map of your websiteâ€™s pages, making it easier for them to crawl and index the site efficiently.

- **Location:** `/sitemap.xml`
- **Purpose:** Provides a list of all important pages on the site for search engines.

### Stripe

Stripe is used for handling secure payments in the Relish shop. It allows customers to complete their purchases using card payment methods while ensuring that all transactions are processed safely and efficiently.

### Facebook
Screenshots of the Relish Facebook page have been used to provide users with a visual representation of our social media presence.

### Mailchimp
Mailchimp integration enables the collection and management of customer email subscriptions. It allows us to send newsletters, promotional offers, and updates directly to our users, helping to maintain engagement with our audience.


With these features, Relish ensures a secure, efficient, and delightful experience for all users while safeguarding their data and fostering trust.

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering

The initial step involved identifying user needs and functionality requirements for the relish application. This included:

User registration and authentication
Product management (CRUD operations)
Category and coffee origin selection
Image upload and display
Price and currency handling


### 2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

To visualize the data structure and relationships between various entities in the application, an Entity Relationship Diagram was created. The primary entities include:

Product: Represents coffee products, including details like name, description, price, currency, and associated images.
Category: Represents different categories of products.
CoffeeOrigin: Represents the origin of the coffee beans.
CoffeeGrind: Represents the grind types available for products.
CoffeeSize: Represents different sizes available for products.

### 3. Wireframes
Wireframes were designed to outline the user interface and user experience. They serve as blueprints for the layout and functionality of key pages within the application.

## User Stories

User stories were essential in guiding the development process, ensuring that the website meets the needs of its users.

### 2. Responsive Design

#### Overview

Responsive design is a crucial aspect of the relish application, ensuring that users have a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The design adapts fluidly to different screen sizes and orientations, enhancing usability and accessibility.

Key Principles

- Fluid Grids: The layout is constructed using a fluid grid system, allowing elements to resize proportionally based on the screen width. This approach ensures that content is well-distributed and easy to navigate on all devices.

- Flexible Images: Images within the application are designed to be responsive, utilizing CSS properties such as max-width: 100%; and height: auto;. This ensures that images resize appropriately without losing their aspect ratio, providing a visually appealing experience.

- Media Queries: CSS media queries are employed to apply different styles based on device characteristics, such as width and resolution. This allows for adjustments in layout, font sizes, and element visibility for optimal presentation on various devices.

### 4. Stylish UI/UX

Design an aesthetically pleasing user interface with appropriate styling using CSS. Utilize visual elements to enhance the experience and make the interface more engaging.

### 5. Code Organization

Maintain a well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns. Use separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to enhance readability and ease of maintenance. Comment the code where necessary to provide insights into the implementation details.


# Testing

## Unit Tests

Unit tests were written to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code. Each function and component of the website was tested individually to verify that they work as expected. The tests cover various aspects such as:

Form validation
User authentication
Enquiry processing
Menu item management
Code Validation

The test results can be seen in the TESTING.md file.

All Python code was validated against the PEP8 style guide to maintain readability and consistency. PEP8 compliance helps in keeping the codebase clean and manageable.

## HTML Validator

The HTML code was validated using the W3C HTML Validator to ensure it meets web standards but has one error.

- The Ethiopian paragraph is doubled up on open and close tags <p> </p>, but when I check the admin panel and click on code view they are not doubled up.
